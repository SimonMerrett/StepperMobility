# StepperMobility
Software to control a wheelchair driven and steered by two stepper motors 

This is work in progress to refine the initial code I have providing controls to the motorised indoor bowls buggy the Bristol Remap Panel has recently converted.

All collaboration is very welcome, both on Github and on https://hackaday.io/project/20734-stepper-motorised-wheelchair
